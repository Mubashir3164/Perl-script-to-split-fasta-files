How to use this Perl script for splitting a FASTA file into multiple output files <br>
1. Download this script and put it in your current working directory. 
2. Open a terminal or command prompt. <br>
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the fasta_split.pl script. <br>
4. Executing the Script <br>

To split a FASTA file into multiple output files, use the following command: <br>
```
perl fasta_split.pl -i input_file.fasta -o output_prefix -n num_files
```
### Parameters.<br>
-i input_file.fasta: Replace this with the path to your input FASTA file.<br>

-o output_prefix: Specify the desired prefix for the output files. For example, if you provide output, the script will generate files named output-split_1.fasta, output-split_2.fasta, and so on.<br>

-n num_files: Set this to the desired number of output files you want to create.<br>

After executing the command, the script will create a directory named split_files (if it doesn't already exist) in the current working directory. Inside this directory, you will find the split FASTA files generated by the script.

> Ensure that you have Perl installed on your system before running the script
